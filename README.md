## 📖 Usage Guide

### Uploading Documents

1. Click the **📎 attachment button** in the chat input
2. Select a PDF or DOCX file
3. Wait for the upload confirmation message
4. Start asking questions about your document!

### Asking Questions

Once you've uploaded documents, you can ask questions like:

- "What is this document about?"
- "Summarize the main points"
- "What does it say about [specific topic]?"

The AI will search your uploaded documents and provide answers with source citations.

### Managing Memory

Check memory statistics:

```bash
npx memvid stats knowledge.mv2
```

View uploaded documents:

```bash
npx memvid timeline knowledge.mv2
```

Search your memory:

```bash
npx memvid find knowledge.mv2 --query "your search term"
```

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Vector Embeddings

Documents are automatically converted to vector embeddings using the `bge-small` model (default). This enables semantic search - finding relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords.

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

When you ask a question:

1. Your query is converted to a vector embedding
2. Similar document chunks are retrieved from memory
3. The LLM generates an answer based on the retrieved context
4. Sources are cited in the response

### Adaptive Retrieval

The system uses adaptive retrieval to automatically determine how many document chunks to use based on relevance scores, ensuring high-quality answers without unnecessary context.
